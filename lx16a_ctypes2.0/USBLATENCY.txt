 You should adjust the latency timer value. From the version Ubuntu 16.04.2, the default latency timer of the usb serial is '16 msec'.
 The lower latency timer value, the faster communication speed. The lowest timer value is 1 msec.

 Note:
 You can check its value by:
 $ cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer

 If you think that the communication is too slow, type following after plugging the usb in to change the latency timer

 Method 1. Type following (you should do this everytime when the usb once was plugged out or the connection was dropped)
 $ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
 $ cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer

 Method 2. If you want to set it as be done automatically, and don't want to do above everytime, make rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d/. For example,
 $ echo ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb-serial\", DRIVER==\"ftdi_sio\", ATTR{latency_timer}=\"1\" > 99-dynamixelsdk-usb.rules
 $ sudo cp ./99-dynamixelsdk-usb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
 $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
 $ sudo udevadm trigger --action=add
 $ cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
